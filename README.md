# A Primitive implementation of Propagarion Networks

The idea is to have a data propagation system would be persistent and
won't lose the state between the program runs. So even if a program
crashes, it should pick up where it left off after a restart.

So fat it has no persistense yet though. My Idea is to find out a
more-less stable API first and then, having the tests in place, change
the inner workings of it.

The work is inspired by Alexey Andreyevich
Radul's
["Propagation Networks"](http://web.mit.edu/~axch/www/phd-thesis.pdf)
I hope it to become a practical as well as theoretically sound and
complete system. So if anyone has any ideas, please feel free to
contribute.

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND IN AN EXPERIMENTAL STAGE. EVERYTHING IS
SUBJECT TO CHANGE.
